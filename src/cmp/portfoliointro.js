          Hello and welcome to my portfolio! As a front-end web developer with a
          background in IT and Software Engineering, I specialize in creating
          interactive web experiences using React, GSAP, and CSS.

        <p>
          Currently, I'm broadening my horizons in the fascinating 3D world with
          Three.js. Driven by the limitless potential of web development, my
          ambition is to expand my expertise into full-stack development.
        </p>
        <p>
          I live by the philosophy of working smarter, not harder, delivering
          efficient and quality solutions. Away from the code, I'm an avid
          gamer, PC builder, and I enjoy conceptualizing website designs.
